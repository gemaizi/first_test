    - stat_smooth
        - something strange going on with se bands (bug)
        - ~~implement method="lm"~~
- scales:
    - ~~scale_colour_brewer~~
    - scale_colour_continuous
        - ~~basic version~~
    - scale_colour_gradient
        - ~~basic version~~
    - scale_colour_gradient2
        - ~~basic version~~
    - scale_x_continuous
        - ~~label and limits~~
        - breaks
    - scale_x_discrete
        - TODO
    - scale_y_continuous
        - ~~label and limits~~
        - breaks
- facets:
    - facet_grid
        - order facets
        - combine so it looks like one chart (doable?)
        - add support for uniform or free scales
    - facet_wrap
        - ~~remove extra axs from figure~~
        - add support for uniform or free scales
- legends:
    - ~~make more consistent / fix spacing~~
    - ~~add support for non-blue continuous colors~~
    - ~~make the title of each legend the variable, not the aes~~
    - make the title of the legend configurable
    - ~~hide the border around the legend (like in R's ggplot2)~~
    - ~~remove colons before labels (R doesn't use them)~~
    - use better ticks placement (sizes, colors) algorithm (like in R)
    - fix: minimal size is too small (invisible) (R uses bigger markers)
    - fix: colormap starts from almost white (invisible) (R uses darker tint)
    - use colorbar and sequential colormaps for continuous data (see brewer2mpl)
    - use color swatches and diverging colormaps for discrete data (see brewer2mpl)
- ~~themes~~:
    - ~~look for better ggplot theme~~
    - ~~theme_bw~~
    - ~~theme_xkcd~~
